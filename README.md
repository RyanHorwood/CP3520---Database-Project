# CP3520---Database-Project
I have created a database using Ubuntu server. I implement my design using SQL, HTML and PHP scripts.

This is the information provided to me by my CNA professor to create this project:

The Prescriptions R-X chain has offered to give you a free life-time supply of drugs if you design and implement its database. Given the rising cost of health care, you agree. Hereâ€™s the information you gather:

Patients are identified by SIN, and their names, addresses and ages must be recorded.

Doctors are identified by SIN. For each doctor, the name, specialty and years of expe- rience must be recorded.

Each pharmaceutical company is identified by name and has a phone number.

For each drug, the trade name and formula must be recorded. Each drug is sold by a given pharmaceutical company, and the trade name identifies a drug uniquely from among the products of that company. If a pharmaceutical company is deleted, you need not keep track of its products any longer.

Each pharmacy has a name, address and phone number.

Every patient has a primary physician. Every doctor has at least one patient.

Each pharmacy sells several drugs and has a price for each. A drug could be sold at several pharmacies and the price could vary from one pharmacy to another.

Doctors prescribe drugs to patients. A doctor could prescribe one or more drugs for several patients, and a patient could obtain prescriptions from several doctors. Each prescription has a date and a quantity associated with it. It must be impossible that two different doctors prescribe the same drug to the same patient on the same day.

Pharmaceutical companies have long-term contracts with pharmacies. A pharmaceu- tical company can contract with several pharmacies and a pharmacy can contract with several pharmaceutical companies. For each contract, you have to store a start date and an end date.

Pharmacies appoint a supervisor for each contract.
